### 3.2 Contract-Specific Pricing Terms

The Client has negotiated the following **pricing terms specific to this Agreement**, as detailed below. These terms shall supersede the Standard Pricing Catalogue where explicitly stated:

**NEFT Processing Fee - Annual Increase Cap:**
- Standard Price (per Schedule C): INR 25.00 per transaction with 3.5% p.a. escalation
- Contracted Price: INR 25.00 per transaction
- **Special Term: Annual escalation capped at INR 0.50 maximum per year**
- Impact: 2026 = INR 25.50 (capped at 0.50, not 0.88), 2027 = INR 26.00 (capped), 2028 = INR 26.50
- vs. Standard: Would be INR 25.88 (2026), INR 26.79 (2027), INR 27.73 (2028)
- Cumulative Loss to Bank: ≈ INR 0.88 + 1.79 + 1.23 ≈ INR 3.90 per transaction over 3 years
- Daily Volume Impact: If 500 daily NEFT transactions = ₹1,950/day loss = ₹700,000/year loss

### 3.3 Escalation Clause

All fees shall be subject to **annual escalation of 3.5% per annum**, effective January 1st of each calendar year, except where explicitly stated otherwise in Section 3.2 above.

**Escalation Formula:**
```
New Fee (Year N) = Previous Fee (Year N-1) × (1 + 3.5%)
```

**Example:** RTGS Processing fee of INR 50.00 in 2025 becomes INR 51.75 in 2026 (50 × 1.035).

**ESCALATION CAP - NEFT PROCESSING:** Annual escalation of the NEFT Processing fee shall be capped at a maximum increase of INR 0.50 per transaction per calendar year. This means that while the standard escalation would be 3.5% per annum, the actual increase is limited to INR 0.50 regardless of the percentage calculation. Example: 2025 = ₹25.00, 2026 = ₹25.50 (max), 2027 = ₹26.00 (max).

The Client is eligible for volume-based discounts based on annual transaction volume as follows:

- **Up to INR 10 Million:** 0% discount (standard pricing)

- **INR 50-200 Million:** 8% discount on payments and trade finance services
- **Above INR 200 Million:** 12% discount on all banking services

Volume is calculated based on total outward transaction amounts in calendar year rupees. Discounts are reconciled annually at fiscal year-end.

### 3.5 Minimum Activity Fee

If monthly transaction volume falls below 25 transactions across all payment services, a **minimum monthly fee of INR 5,000** shall be charged for that month.

### 3.6 Fee Invoice and Payment
